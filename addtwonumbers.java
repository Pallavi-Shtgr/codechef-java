// Chef and Chefina are playing with dice. In one turn, both of them roll their dice at once.
// They consider a turn to be good if the sum of the numbers on their dice is greater than 6
// Given that in a particular turn Chef and Chefina got 
// X and Y on their respective dice, find whether the turn was good.
