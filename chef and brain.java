// Chef and Brain Speed
// In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of X bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at 
// Y bits per second, is he prone to errors?If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.
// Input Format
// The only line of input contains two space separated integers X and Y â€” the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.
